# Weather Application
The Weather Application is a simple Python program that retrieves and displays the current weather information for a given city, state, and country. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and presents it in a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library.


## Features
Fetches current weather data including temperature, humidity, and weather description.
Supports entering a city name, state, and country for location specificity.
Displays the weather information in a clean and user-friendly GUI.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-application.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd weather-application
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up for a free account.
Create a file named .env in the project directory and add the following line, replacing <your_api_key> with your actual API key:
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

## Usage
Run the application by executing the main.py file:
python main.py
The Weather Application window will appear. 

## Follow these steps to retrieve the weather information:
Enter the name of a city in the "City" field.
Optionally, enter the state in the "State" field and the country in the "Country" field for a more specific location.
